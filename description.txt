Mod version: v0.1.23
	- Added different dialog to the Zoologist while she is transformed.
	- Cross mod shop items are now much safer. The game will no longer throw an error if the item is not found.
	- Fixed "Like" and "Dislike" text in the Bestiary for the Fisherman.

Known issues:
	- Fisherman sells Pylons for free (tML bug I assume)
